### Project _DEEPER_:

#### Deep Exploratory Engine for Precise Expert Reasoning

The project is concerned with developing machine learning guidance for modern
state-of-the-art automatic theorem provers (ATPs) capable of generating correct
proofs. In particular, it focuses on _AI guidance for higher-order and
dependently typed calculi_, which are essential for directly addressing problems
in the formalization of mathematics, as well as _guidance for the Prover9
system_, which plays a crucial role in the AIM project by Kinyon and Veroff. The
approach combines _neural and symbolic learning methods_: deep learning for proof
guidance is complemented by the hints method, which is critical in handling
very large proofs of open conjectures.

#### Goals

To achieve the overall goal of powerful automated reasoning for mathematics, the project pursues the following four objectives:

1. Developing effective AI-based guidance for higher-order automated reasoning
   systems that can prove large numbers of goals in formalized mathematics
   libraries.

2. Designing proof advice and efficient automation for dependently typed proof
   foundations.

3. Integrating strong guided automated theorem provers into modern
   state-of-the-art proof assistants, including their hammer systems, and
   optimizing them for large proof libraries.

4. Advancing towards an autonomous reasoning system able to tackle open
   mathematical problems, using learning techniques such as conjecturing,
   reinforcement, and inspiration from existing proofs.

#### Partnership 

The project is an international cooperation between 

+ ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) (UoM), Australia, and
+ ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en/) (CTU), Czech Republic,

uniting complementary expertise to develop AI-guided automated reasoning systems.
