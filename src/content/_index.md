### Project _DEEPER_:

#### Deep Exploratory Engine for Precise Expert Reasoning

We propose to develop machine learning guidance for modern state-of-the-art
automatic theorem provers (ATPs) able to generate correct proofs. In
particular, we will target AI guidance for higher-order and dependently typed
calculi which are important for directly attacking problems in formalization of
mathematics and guidance for the Prover9 system crucial in the AIM project by
Kinyon and Veroff. Our approach will combine neural and symbolic learning
methods. Specifically, we intend to use deep learning for proof guidance
complemented by the hints method, which is critical in the very large proofs of
open conjectures.

To achieve this overall goal of powerful automated reasoning for mathematics we will work on the following four objectives:

1. We will develop effective AI-based guidance for higher-order automated reasoning systems able to prove large numbers of goals in formalized mathematics libraries.
2. We will design proof advice and efficient automation for dependently typed proof foundations.
3. We will integrate strong guided automated theorem provers into modern state-of-the-art proof assistants including their hammer systems and optimize them for their proof libraries.
4. Finally, we will work on an autonomous reasoning system able to tackle open mathematical problems using learning techniques including conjecturing, reinforcement, and taking inspiration from existing proofs.
